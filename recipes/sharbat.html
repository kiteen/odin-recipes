        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe for sharbat, a sweet drink, comes from the late fifteenth-century Ni'matnama manuscript, also known as the Sultan's Book of Delights. Compiled under Ghiyath Shah, Sultan of the Malwa Sultanate in Central India, and, later his son Nasir Shah, this manuscript contains recipes for a range of culinary delicacies, as well as perfumes and medicines. The vivid miniatures that accompany the recipes occasionally depict the Sultan himself observing the cooking process, as shown above. Recipes for sharbat abound in the manuscript, with variations featuring ingredients like wild dates, jackfruit, mango, and pomegranate. This recipe, drawn from Norah M. Titley's English translation of the manuscript, is one of the more detailed variants, a recipe for lime sharbat. See the bottom of this page for a note on units of measurement.</p>
