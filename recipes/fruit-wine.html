        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Domestic workers and householders in seventeenth-century England often recorded their tried-and-true culinary and medical recipes in manuscript notebooks known as receipt or household books. This recipe for fruit wine comes from <a href="https://luna.folger.edu/luna/servlet/detail/FOLGER~3~3~13704~270020:A-book-of-receipts-which-was-given-%3Fsort%3Dcall_number%252Cmpsortorder1?qvq=q:cherry%20wine;sort:call_number%2Cmpsortorder1;lc:FOLGER~3~3&mi=9&trs=107">a medical manuscript in the Folger Library</a> that contains a number of recipes for beverages like mead, wine, cider, and chocolate, all of which were also understood to have certain health benefits. The fruit medley in this recipe makes the most of summer's bounty.</p>
