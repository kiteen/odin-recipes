    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Dating to antiquity, xocolatl was first developed by  indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica, and one of the key early manuscript sources for this cacao drink is the <a href="https://www.getty.edu/projects/florentine-codex/">Florentine Codex</a>, originally titled <i>La Historia General de las Cosas de Nueva España</i>, which was compiled in  sixteenth-century Mexico City. This encyclopaedic manuscript provides a record of Nahua culture and life, including details about the preparation and medicinal properties of age-old cacao-based decoctions. The Franciscan friar Bernadino de Sahagún is often credited as the author, but the work was evidently produced in partnership with Nahua people and is, in fact, written in both Nahuatl and Spanish. The following recipe is inspired by accounts of xocolatl in the Florentine Codex, with measurements left to the mixologist's discretion.</p>
