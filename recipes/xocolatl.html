    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Dating to antiquity, xocolatl was first developed by the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica, and one of the key early manuscript sources for this cacao drink is the Florentine Codex (1590), which was compiled in  sixteenth-century Mexico City. This encyclopaedic manuscript provides a seminal record of Nahua culture and life, including details about the preparation and medicinal properties of age-old cacao-based decoctions. The Franciscan friar Bernadino de Sahag√∫n is often credited as the author, but the work was produced in partnership with Nahua people and is, in fact, written in both Nahuatl and Spanish. The following recipe is inspired by the account in the the Florentine Codex.</p>
